 * one ticket, so it MUST NOT carry `edges`. An outgoing edge names a target
 * ticket that is — by construction — absent from a single-ticket file; the
 * adlc-antigravity plugin's loadTickets reports that as a dangling-edge error,
 * and its railPreconditions fails CLOSED on ANY validation error, denying
 * EVERY structured write for the whole build (not just rail paths). Only leaf
 * tickets (no outgoing edges) enforce correctly otherwise, which is why the bug
 * was invisible (B11 / adlc repo #142: the plugin stays fail-closed on dangling
 * edges, the booster projects edge-free single-ticket files).
 *
 * Two separate named functions rather than an option flag so the whole-plan and
 * single-ticket call sites cannot silently swap. Keeps only what rail resolution
 * and the plugin validator need: id + title (validateTicket requires a string
 * title) + rails, plus scope. Drops edges (the bug), and body/duration (not part
 * of rail resolution; the builder's charter comes from its worktree AGENTS.md).
