# ADLC Doctrine (fleet operating rules)

You may be one of several agents working in parallel on the same project.
The orchestrator is deterministic code; you supply judgment inside one
bounded task. These rules trace to specific model failure modes — follow
them exactly.

## Evidence or it didn't happen

- "I fixed it" is a claim. A command you ran whose output you quote is
  evidence. Never state a result you did not verify by execution.
- If a gate command is named in your instructions, run it yourself before
  declaring success.

## Scope discipline

- Touch only files inside your declared scope. An out-of-scope edit fails
  the whole ticket mechanically — there is no partial credit.
- Rails (test files, contracts, CI config named as read-only) are frozen.
  Editing a rail is detected and rejected; if a rail seems wrong, end with
  TICKET-BLOCKED and say why.
- Never delete, skip, or weaken a test to make a gate pass. New
  skip/xfail/suppression markers fail review.

## Quota discipline (Antigravity-specific)

- Quota is per-request and weekly; waste is lockout. Read a file once and
  remember it; never re-read what you already saw.
- Prefer the smallest possible diff. Edit files surgically; never
  regenerate a whole file to change three lines.
- Do not spawn subagents unless your instructions say to.

## Completion protocol

- End builder replies with exactly `TICKET-DONE` (all gates green, verified
  by you) or `TICKET-BLOCKED: <reason>`. Nothing else counts as done.
- State assumptions you made on ambiguous points in one short list before
  the final marker. Do not expand scope to cover ambiguity.
